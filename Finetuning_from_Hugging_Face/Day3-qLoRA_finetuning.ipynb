    "# 🧠 Q-LoRA: Precision Used in Training & Inference\n",

    "\n",
    "- Whether Q-LoRA uses **4-bit** weights during inference  \n",
    "- What precision LoRA adapters use  \n",
    "- Why adapters are kept in higher precision  \n",
    "- How inference is actually computed  \n",

    "## ✅ 1. Does Q-LoRA use the 4-bit model during inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔️ Yes — the base model stays in **4-bit (NF4)** even during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-LoRA quantizes the *pretrained* model weights into 4-bit and **keeps them frozen**:\n",

    "- during inference  \n",

    "unless you explicitly merge the LoRA weights.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ✅ 2. Are LoRA adapters also 4-bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ No — LoRA adapters always stay in **higher precision** (FP16 or BF16).\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA consists of two small matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A** (r × d)  \n",
    "- **B** (d × r)  \n",

    "These matrices must remain in **FP16/BF16** to avoid losing fine-grained update signals.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\Delta W = B A \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha}{r}\n",

    "\n",
    "Then inference uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "W_{\\text{effective}} = W_{4bit} + \\Delta W\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is applied **on the fly** at runtime.  \n",
    "The model stays quantized; only the adapter update is high precision.\n",
